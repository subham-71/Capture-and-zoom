# Capture-and-zoom
You can take a picture from real world using the script that requires access of your camera. Then using some gestures you can zoom and inspect the picture that you have taken.

This can be used in real life cases where we can take a picture of any object from our surrounding and then inspect in detail about it using our hand gestures.
